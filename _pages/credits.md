This repository was forked (then detached) by me from the [academic pages repo](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou), which was in turn forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. 

These are some awesome resources I found while making this website:
- [Liquid syntax guide](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/control-flow/)
- [A helpful YT tutorial](https://youtu.be/g6AJ9qPPoyc?si=2VykebuArCFtONaa)
