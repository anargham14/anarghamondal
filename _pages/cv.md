Work experience
======
* Fall and Spring Semester Projects (2024-25):
  * Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune
  * Duties include: Investigating cross-correlations between the 3D matter power spectrum and galaxy clusters with
the Nearest Neighbor Cumulative Distribution Functions (NNCDFs) to impose stronger bounds on the
total mass of the three neutrino mass eigenstates compared to the matter power spectrum.
