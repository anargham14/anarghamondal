I haven't boiled down to a particular stream of research yet, but broadly they relate to large-scale structure formation in the universe and a bit of astroparticle physics.

Some of the broad areas I have worked in are listed as follows.

## Effects of Massive Neutrinos 

Neutrinos, although very light, are numerous enough to affect structure formation in the universe. Inverting the setup, we can try to infer constraints on neutrino mass from how matter clusters in the cosmos. Since August 2024, I have been investigating how cross-correlations between the 3D matter field and the positions of halos can help us predict theoretical constraints on the total mass of neutrino flavors for upcoming cosmological surveys. One of the primary goals of the project is to evaluate whether the k-nearest neighbour formalism for tracer-field cross-correlations can give tighter constraints than the conventional two-point cross-correlation function.

I am also working on a project that tries to constrain $M_\nu$ by probing the halo environment from observables in CMB$\times$ LSS simulations.
## The Hubble Tension

I have been interested in working on the Hubble Tension since I got the opportunity to work on a related problem at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, Tokyo, with Dr. Maria Giovanna Dainotti. Our analyses and results have been compiled in a paper, published in the Journal of High Energy Astrophysics, and describes the compilation of a new joint sample of Type Ia Supernovae for better analysis and measurements of the Hubble constant. The paper is available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214404825000862).
