I haven't boiled down to a particular stream of research yet, but broadly they relate to large-scale structure formation in the universe and a bit of astroparticle physics.

Some of the broad areas I have worked in are listed as follows.

## Effects of Massive Neutrinos 

Neutrinos, although very light, are numerous enough to affect structure formation in the universe. Inverting the setup, we can try to infer constraints on neutrino mass from how matter clusters in the cosmos. Since August 2024, I have been investigating how cross-correlations between the 3D matter field and the positions of halos can help us predict theoretical constraints on the total mass of neutrino flavors for upcoming cosmological surveys. One of the primary goals of the project is to evaluate whether the k-nearest neighbour formalism for tracer-field cross-correlations can give tighter constraints than the conventional two-point cross-correlation function.
