## Association Football
I have been following the Premier League avidly for almost a decade now. I support Manchester City, and 
will vehemently defend the fact that Kevin De Bruyne is the best midfielder in Premier League history. The 'Centurions' season made me fall in love with the Manchester Blues, and I could not go back after watching a bald David Silva ball out.

I am a part of the football team that participtes in IISER's internal football league - the IFL, and usually play LB for the team "Alpha-Q".

My evenings are often spent playing a friendly match.

<!-- My mother is a huge fan of the great Diego Armando Maradona, which spurred me to support Argentina in the international tournaments. Like most Bengali households of the early 2000s, only international competitions were enjoyed with much vigour, and late-night La Liga or Premier League watch parties were practically unheard of. It was at this juncture that I fell in love with a long-haired Argentinian wonderkid from Barcelona, Lionel Andres Messi. I remeber arguing with my mother sometime during the fervour of the World Cup Quarter Finals  -->
## Recreational Problem Solving
This actually started of as one of my habits when I was preparing for Math Olympiads. I am not really picky about the problems I like to think about, but I end up spending more time with Physics, Mathematics and coding challenges. I really enjoy thinking about high-school level Physics Olympiad problems, regardless of whether I actually solve them or not. 
[AoPs](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) and IPhO longlists are my favourite resource for problems. The problem book by Krotov has to be my all-time favourite for recreational problem solving.

One outlet of this hobby is that I am an avid participant in the question-making sessions of [Mimamsa](https://www.mimamsa.info/) 

## Reading
Probably the most vanilla of all hobbies, but I have always greatly enjoyed reading. Perhaps because I have always had a weakness for great and dramatic stories. My mother was the heaviest influence behind this, being the most avid reader I have ever seen.

I have recently found myself being attracted more towards non-fiction than fiction, which used to be a staple for my teenage self. I especially love the work of authors who put effort to liven up even the seemingly mundane biographies and anecdotes - like James Gleick and Walter Isaacson.

My favourite book is [The Music of the Primes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208916.The_Music_of_the_Primes) by Prof. [Marcus du Sautoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_du_Sautoy). Funnily enough, this book primarily based on Number Theory was an integral force behind me taking up Physics as my major! 

## Rock
I love listenig to music when I am cycling to class, working out at the gym, or just grinding coursework that I don't find particularly appealing. Most of the times, this is some milieu of blues, grundge, or alt rock. I hardly listen to a single band but _Guns N' Roses_, _Nirvana_, _Red Hot Chilli Peppers_ and _Pink Floyd_ are recurring favourites. The list is, of course, incomplete with the two GOATs of the Bengali rock n' roll scene - _[Fossils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossils_(band))_ and _[Lakkhichhara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakkhichhara)_
