Welcome to my website! I do not know how to label this venture - it is definitely not a full-fledged professional website, yet it is something more than a personal one. I would consider this to be a looking-glass into my life, aspirations and things that I spend most of my time doing, should you be interested in them at all. 

The idea of making a website sprung out in December 2024, when, during the infinite free-time of my winter holidays, I decided to play around with Git and GitHub. That is when I stumbled across the idea of making a Jekyll-based website hosted on GitHub Pages. This is simply a crude accumulation of markdown and html files I managd to string together while playing around, and thought would be fun to publish on the internet.

One important thing that needs to be pointed out - this website is still very much under development, with no promises on when it would be ready. On a brighter note, I do plan to start uploading stuff that I had a lot of fun working on, and hopefully, the mere existence of this website would spur me on with that task. Check out the tab "Cool Stuff" for updates on the same.
